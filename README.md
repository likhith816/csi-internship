   - Explanation of all 7 layers  
   - Working mechanism (sender → receiver path)  
   - Real-time protocol examples for each layer  
   - Layer-wise functions and responsibilities

2. 📗 **R&D Document on TCP/IP Model**  
   - Overview of TCP/IP layers  
   - Functionality of each layer  
   - Mapping between OSI & TCP/IP  
   - Protocols used in each layer

3. 📕 **R&D Document on TCP & UDP Protocols**  
   - In-depth comparison between TCP and UDP  
   - Working mechanism (e.g., 3-way handshake for TCP)  
   - Advantages, disadvantages, and use cases  
   - Tabular comparison and real-world examples
   - How HTTP and HTTPS function (Request-Response, SSL/TLS)  
   - Use cases and differences  
   - ICMP protocol usage in network diagnostics (ping, traceroute)
